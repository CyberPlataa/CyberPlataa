<h1>Hi, I'm Alexis! A martial artist who's taking his passion for learning techniques and trying to evolve with the combat sports world to IT/Cybersecurity. I catch myself feeling wide-eyed learning new technologies as I do with martial arts. I'm always asking questions, and chasing that feeling of achieving new things. This is a documentation of my journey thus far. If you have any tips for better documentation or cool new technologies; heck even techniques. Please shoot me a message!</h1>
